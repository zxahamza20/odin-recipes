  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Biryani is a fragrant, spiced rice dish that originated in South Asia and is widely enjoyed across India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and beyond. It is traditionally made by layering long-grain basmati rice with marinated meat such as chicken, lamb, or beef, or sometimes vegetables, along with yogurt, onions, garlic, ginger, and a rich blend of spices like saffron, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon. The dish is slow-cooked so the flavors meld together, giving biryani its signature aroma and depth.</p>

  <p>What makes biryani special is the variety of regional styles, such as Hyderabadi, Lucknowi, and Sindhi biryani, each with its own balance of spices and cooking techniques. Often served with raita or salad, biryani is both a celebratory and comfort food, commonly prepared for festivals, family gatherings, and special occasions.</p>
