  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Pad kee mow, often called “drunken noodles,” is a popular Thai stir-fried noodle dish known for its bold, savory flavors. It’s typically made with wide rice noodles, garlic, chili, and a mix of vegetables like Chinese broccoli, bell peppers, and baby corn, along with protein such as chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu. The sauce combines soy sauce, oyster sauce, and fish sauce, creating a rich, salty, and slightly sweet base.</p>

  <p>What sets pad kee mow apart is its fragrant use of Thai basil and its spicy kick, which gives the dish a fresh, aromatic finish. Despite the nickname “drunken noodles,” there’s no alcohol in the recipe—the name is commonly said to come from the idea that the dish pairs well with drinks or cures a late-night craving. The result is a hearty, spicy, and satisfying meal that’s a staple in Thai cuisine.</p>
