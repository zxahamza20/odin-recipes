  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>Fudgy brownies are dense, rich, and intensely chocolatey, with a texture that leans closer to truffles than cake. They have a moist, almost melt-in-your-mouth interior, often achieved by using more fat than flour and plenty of melted chocolate or cocoa. The top is usually thin and slightly crackly, giving way to a soft, dark center that feels indulgent with every bite.</p>

  <p>What sets fudgy brownies apart is their deep, decadent flavor and satisfying heaviness. They’re not airy or fluffy—instead, they’re chewy, gooey, and unapologetically rich. Perfect on their own or paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, fudgy brownies are the go-to dessert when you want something comforting, chocolate-forward, and luxurious.</p>
